# severance.js
Found a little inspiration to make this after seeing the Apple TV original series "**Severance**"

## Project Description
The goal of the project is to emulate the software used at Lumon Industries. In it's early concept, it will be a merely visual replica of the software - only loosely based on the show's version. Eventually, I hope to make the software more interactive and give it the proper functionality as seen in the series. This is a hobby project for which I hope to make into a full-fleged useless application that is fully functional and fully unimportant.

## Current state of application
Currently, the application is purely visual and has limited interactivity capabilities. The script generates a series of cells, randomly generating integers - then adds simple animation to each cell respectively to give the numbers a sort of "floating" effect. The mouse also acts as a point of interest, increasing nearby cells in size using CSS scale properties. This project is in it's early stages and will be updated regularly to better reflect the show's vision.

## Plans for future feature implementation
As of now, the application is purely visual (v1.2)

My plans for the future of the software involves a plethora of interactivity with the digits, of which you will be able to mark, delete, and dispose of just as in the show.
